	Example of notification (After you do the config):
	This is going to send a message into your server announcements channel

	local message = blablabla
	local title = test
	Webhook.sendMessage(title, message, WEBHOOK_COLOR_YELLOW,
                        announcementChannels["serverAnnouncements"])

	Dev Comment: This lib can be used to add special webhook channels
	where you are going to send your messages. Webhook.specialSend was designed
	to be used with countless possibilities.
